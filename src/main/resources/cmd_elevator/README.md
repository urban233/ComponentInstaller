# CmdElevator
CmdElevator is a tiny C# tool, that is used to run the Windows command prompt with admin privileges.

## Build from source
To build this tool, create a new C# project with the console application template (with either Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).
Copy the code of the CmdElevator.cs into the Program.cs file. 
To produce a single standalone EXE file, create a new publishing task (with either Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider) 
and choose the options for a self-contained application.
